This churn analysis, conducted in Excel, examines key customer segments to identify patterns driving customer attrition within a telecom provider. The analysis focuses on gender, customer tenure, contract type, and specific service attributes to determine high-risk groups. 

### Key findings include:

Gender: No significant difference in churn rates between male and female customers.

Tenure: 48% of churn occurs within the first year of service, highlighting early tenure as a critical risk period.

Contract Type: Month-to-month subscribers show the highest churn rate (43%), suggesting contract flexibility increases the likelihood of churn.

Other Factors: Higher churn rates are also observed among customers without partners (33%), those using fiber optic internet (43%), and those on paperless billing (34%).

These insights are visualized using Excel tools like pivot tables and charts to uncover trends and inform targeted retention strategies. Please download the Excel file to view the whole analysis.
